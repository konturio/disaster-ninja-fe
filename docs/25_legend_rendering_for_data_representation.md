# Chapter 25: Legend Rendering for Data Representation

Welcome to Chapter 25! 🎨 In this chapter, we’ll explore one of the most visually powerful features in Disaster Ninja: the legend system!

> 🧠 “Wait… what is a legend?”

Well, in a map, a legend is like a **visual decoder.**  
It explains what colors, shapes, and icons represent. 🗺️

In Disaster Ninja, the legend does even more — it helps users interpret complex, multivariable data in a way that is clear, color-coded, and quick to understand. 🔍🌈

Let’s get started by understanding the concept behind…

---

## 🎯 Legend Rendering — What Problem Does It Solve?

Consider this scenario:

➡️ You're looking at a map showing health risk.  
It uses:
- Shades of red for high-risk zones
- Circles for population clusters
- Arrows for outbreak direction

❓ Without a legend: You’d be guessing!

✅ With a legend: You instantly understand what the data means.

🧠 In Disaster Ninja, legend rendering solves this problem automatically by:
- Explaining multivariate color systems
- Showing icons and data classes
- Dynamically matching the visualization on the map

Legends turn mystery maps into clear stories. ✨

---

## 🧠 What Is a Legend in Software Terms?

In Disaster Ninja, a "legend" is a component that:

- Renders a group of symbols, icons, or color blocks  
- Labels them with human-readable text  
- Matches them directly to a data style used on the map

Think of the legend as a **mini palette + dictionary** for what you're seeing onscreen.

---

## 🧰 Legend Types in Disaster Ninja

Disaster Ninja supports several types of legends for different types of data:

| Legend Type | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| 📊 Univariate | One variable, rendered by color shades | Population density (light to dark blue) |
| 🎯 Bivariate | Two variables crossed into a matrix grid | Health Risk vs. Readiness |
| 🎨 Multivariate | Multiple variables each shown via styled blocks or symbols | CPI Index with 3 metrics |
| 🧭 Icon-based | Legends using icons (e.g. arrows, circles) | Direction of evacuation, type of buildings |

Let’s walk through how the system assembles and displays these legends.

---

## 🧩 Key Concepts and Components

| Concept | What It Does | Analogy |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| Legend Entry | Represents one symbol and its meaning | Dictionary entry |
| Legend Box | Group of entries under a title | Visual vocab list 📚 |
| Bivariate Grid | 2D matrix to represent two indicators | Tic-tac-toe board with colored cells |
| Multivariate Panel | Stacked color bars/icons for multiple factors | Pie chart’s label system |
| Legend Renderer | The component that outputs the legend | The screen painter 🎨 |

You can think of this chapter as learning to paint a “map label”. 🎨🗺️

---

## 🛠️ How Legend Rendering Works in Practice

Let’s explore one use case step-by-step:

> “I want to show a bivariate legend combining:  
> - Program Reach (X-axis)  
> - Risk Level (Y-axis)  
> … and display the 3x3 matrix of colors.”

This is a bivariate-style legend. Here’s how we do it.

---

### ✅ Step 1: Legend Data Model

Each legend is built from a structured model:

```ts
export interface LegendEntry {
  label: string;
  color?: string;
  icon?: JSX.Element;
}

export interface LegendGroup {
  title: string;
  entries: LegendEntry[];
}
```

🧾 These can model almost any legend:
- Color only? ✅
- Icon only? ✅
- Both icon + color? ✅

---

### ✅ Step 2: Create the Legend

For our bivariate use case:

```ts
const legendData: LegendGroup = {
  title: 'Program Reach vs. Risk Level',
  entries: [
    { label: 'Low Reach + High Risk', color: '#ff0000' },
    { label: 'Medium Reach + Medium Risk', color: '#cccc00' },
    { label: 'High Reach + Low Risk', color: '#00ff00' },
    // ...add all matrix combinations
  ]
}
```

🧾 This can be dynamically generated using utility functions tied to the data source.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Use the Legend Renderer

Disaster Ninja provides a reusable React component:

```tsx
import { LegendPanel } from '@/components/LegendPanel';

<LegendPanel legend={legendData} />
```

The component takes care of:
- Showing the title
- Laying out color blocks or icons
- Labeling each entry cleanly
- Supporting responsive layout

---

### ✅ Step 4: Contextual Rendering

In many cases, the legend shown depends on:
- The type of active layer
- The visualization style (bivariate, multivariate, MCDA)

Using Reatom state, each legend is dynamically tied to the map rendering logic.

So when a bivariate layer is active, the page auto-displays its legend — no extra coding needed!

---

## 🔬 Behind the Scenes: Dynamic Legend Generation

Disaster Ninja links together:

1. 🧠 Data styles for the layer (`colorMatrix`, `iconMap`, `axisLabels`)  
2. 🔧 Configuration logic  
3. 🎨 Legend Formatter component

This ensures:
- The map style and legend are always in sync  
- Users don’t get confused by false legend-color mappings  
- Advanced visualizations like bivariate matrix cell merging are supported

Example generator:

```ts
export function getLegendFromBivariateMatrix(matrix): LegendGroup {
  return {
    title: 'Program Reach vs. Risk Level',
    entries: matrix.cells.map(cell => ({
      label: cell.label,
      color: cell.color,
    })),
  };
}
```

---

## 🎯 Supporting Multivariate, MCDA, or Icon-Based Legends

Legends are flexible! You can also:

- Show icon-only entries  
- Combine multiple legend groups under one panel  
- Pass performance scores (used in MCDA layers)  
- Use triangular axis shapes (used in some bivariate + multivariate styles)

These all use the same LegendPanel API — just with different inputs.

---

## 👀 Where in the App This Is Used

You’ll see the legend system power:

- 📍 Layer legends for MCDA and metrics
- 🟡 Color-coded matrix explanations (bivariate grid)
- 📊 Tool panels that render extra layer explanations in context

Components involved:
- `<LegendPanel />` - the flexible UI container  
- `legendFormatter.ts` - converts metric matrix config → visual text + color
- `LegendWithMap` - image + text combo used in side panels

---

## ✅ Summary

Whew! That was a colorful journey. 🔴🟡🟢

Let’s recap what you now know:

✅ A legend decodes data visualizations on the map  
✅ Disaster Ninja supports multiple legend types: bivariate, multivariate, icon-based  
✅ You can define a legend using data structures like LegendEntry and LegendGroup  
✅ The LegendPanel component renders the UI dynamically  
✅ Legends stay in sync with the data thanks to centralized formatting functions

Now when someone says, “What does this blue square mean?”...  
You’ll have a powerful, pretty answer ready. 💪

# Chapter 25: Legend Rendering for Data Representation

Welcome back, map magician! 🧙‍♀️🗺️

In [Chapter 24: Tooltip Service](24_tooltip_service.md), we learned how to show smart, lightweight help messages when users hover over different parts of the map UI.

In this chapter, we’ll tackle something just as important for visual storytelling:

> “How do we show users what all the map colors and symbols mean?”

🎯 That’s where the **Legend Rendering System** comes in.

---

## 🎯 Central Use Case: “What does red mean on this map?”

Imagine you’re an emergency responder looking at a colorful heatmap. You see green, orange, and red zones…

> “Hmm, does red mean danger or safety? What’s the range? What do the icons mean?”

That’s why every good map needs a ➡️ legend.

✅ A legend explains:
- What colors represent
- What icon symbols mean
- What metric scales apply (e.g. "0.0 – 1.0")

The Legend Rendering System automatically generates this from your layer styles — so users always understand what they’re seeing.

---

## 🧩 What Is the Legend Renderer?

> It’s a component that figures out what visual symbols to show at the bottom or side of the screen based on active layers.

In other words:
- 🧠 Reads the active map layers (e.g. MCDA, bivariate risk, population)
- 🎨 Figures out what color scales or shapes are used
- 🔖 Generates a neat visual key that tells the user how to read the map

Legends aren’t hard-coded — they update dynamically as the user changes layers or styles.

✨ Automatic clarity!

---

## 🧱 Key Concepts

Let’s break down its parts:

| Concept | What It Means | Analogy |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| Legend Item | One entry like "Red = High Risk" | A label in your color code |
| Legend Group | A collection of related items (e.g. flood categories) | A legend section 📦 |
| Legend Renderer | A component that loops over active layers and generates visual keys | Visual helper 🙋 |
| Source Styles | Where the legend gets its color or symbol info | Style blueprints 🖼️ |

---

## 🧪 Example: Auto-Legend for a Bivariate Layer

Let’s say you have a map showing:

- X axis: Flood risk (low → high)
- Y axis: Population density (low → high)

The style generator uses a 3×3 color matrix (see [Chapter 20: Bivariate and Multivariate Style Generators](20_bivariate_and_multivariate_style_generators.md))

🧠 The Legend Renderer:
- Detects it’s a bivariate style
- Fetches the X and Y axis labels ("Flood", "Population")
- Pulls the 9 color squares from the style matrix
- Shows a 3×3 legend grid with matching labels and a caption like:
  > "Risk: Red = High Flood, High Pop."

🧙‍♀️ The legend reads your map’s mind.

---

## 👩‍💻 Using the Legend Component

In your frontend layout, just add:

```tsx
<LegendPanel />
```

✅ It’ll read whatever layers are currently visible and show:
- Gradient bars (for continuous data)
- Color chips (for category or MCDA styles)
- 3×3 grid (for bivariate layers)
- Icon lookups (if symbols are used)

—

When the user changes layers or toggles visibility, the legend updates automatically.

---

## 📦 Sample Output (Example from MCDA)

Color layers were generated showing:

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 🟥 Red   | High Priority |
| 🟧 Orange | Medium Priority |
| 🟨 Yellow| Low Priority |

Legend panel will show:

```
MCDA Priority Scores
🟥 High Priority
🟧 Medium Priority
🟨 Low Priority
```

With a styled header, fixed icons, and colors.

---

## ⚙️ What Happens Behind the Scenes?

Let’s walk through the process when map styles change.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant UI as User Interface
  participant Map as Map Layer Manager
  participant LegendSys as Legend Renderer
  participant StyleGen as Layer Styles

  UI->>Map: Toggle on "MCDA Score Layer"
  Map->>LegendSys: Notify new active layer
  LegendSys->>StyleGen: Request legend info for that layer
  StyleGen-->>LegendSys: Return color/label pairs
  LegendSys->>UI: Render legend with that info
```

🧠 It acts like a color translator — converting styles to user-understandable meaning.

---

## 🔧 Internal Example: Bivariate Legend Definition

📁 `/map/legend/builders/bivariateLegendBuilder.ts`

```ts
export function buildBivariateLegend(layerStyle) {
  const { colorMatrix, xLabel, yLabel } = layerStyle;

  return {
    type: "bivariate",
    caption: `${xLabel} vs ${yLabel}`,
    grid: colorMatrix, // 3x3 or bigger
    xAxis: ["Low", "Med", "High"],
    yAxis: ["Low", "Med", "High"],
  };
}
```

🔥 Now the LegendPanel sees this and renders a 3×3 grid with small colored cells and axis labels like this:

```
      Population
        ↑
        │
Low ───────────► Flood
```

Each cell is colored according to the matrix. Easy to read, hard to misinterpret!

---

## 🧠 Where This Plug In

You’ll see legend generation happening in:

📁 `/map/legend/generateLegendForLayer.ts`

- Detects the layer style type (gradient, bivariate, category)
- Selects builder function (like `buildBivariateLegend`)
- Returns a structure like:

```ts
{
  type: "gradient",
  caption: "Flood Risk Score",
  stops: [
    { color: "#FFFFFF", label: "Low" },
    { color: "#FF0000", label: "High" }
  ]
}
```

📁 `/components/LegendPanel.tsx`

- Subscribes to active layers
- Renders blocks of color + labels

---

## 🛠️ Supporting MCDA, Thresholds, Scenarios

Because styles (and scores) can vary by scenario, the Legend Rendering system is smart enough to update when:
- MCDA configuration changes
- Thresholds filter out zones
- Bivariate dimensions shift

🧙‍♀️ One panel, many dynamic views.

—

Example: If a user changes axis from "Access" to "Vulnerability", the legend updates axis labels automatically — even if colors stay the same!

---

## ✅ Summary

Let’s summarize what you now know:

✔ The Legend Rendering System explains what map colors/symbols mean  
✔ It works dynamically — reacts to active layers and styles  
✔ Bivariate matrices turn into labeled grids  
✔ Gradient stops and labels are pulled from live styles  
✔ MCDA, thresholds, layers all influence the legend output

Thanks to this, every dynamic map gets clarity with just one glance 👁️🎨

        'For the three people whose accounts were known to be compromised, the attackers gained access to their emails, cloud storage drives, calendars, and contacts and also performed a Google Takeout, using a service that exports data from the core and additional services of a Google account.\n\nVarious security companies have reported on phishing campaigns by APT42 targeting Middle East-focused researchers, civil society groups, and dissidents. Most of them identify APT42 based on targeting patterns and technical evidence. Organizations such as Google and the cybersecurity companies Recorded Future, Proofpoint, and Mandiant have linked APT 42 to Iranian authorities. Identifying and naming a threat actor helps researchers to identify, track, and link hostile cyber activity.\n\nIn October 2022, a Human Rights Watch staff member working on the Middle East and North Africa region received suspicious messages on WhatsApp from a person pretending to work for a think tank based in Lebanon, inviting them to a conference. The joint investigation revealed that the phishing links sent via WhatsApp, once clicked, directed the target to a fake login page that captured the user’s email password and authentication code. The research team investigated the infrastructure that hosted the malicious links and identified additional targets of this ongoing campaign.\n\nHuman Rights Watch and Amnesty International contacted the 18 high profile individuals identified as targets of this campaign. Fifteen of them responded and confirmed that they had received the same WhatsApp messages at some point between September 15 and November 25, 2022.\n\nOn November 23, 2022, a second Human Rights Watch staff member was also targeted. They received the same WhatsApp messages from the same number that contacted other targets.\n\nSocial engineering and phishing attempts remain key components of Iranian cyberattacks. Since 2010, Iranian operators have targeted members of foreign governments, militaries, and businesses, as well as political dissidents and human rights defenders. Over time, these attacks have become more sophisticated in the ways they execute what is known as “social engineering.”\n\nAccording to Mandiant, a US-based cybersecurity company, APT42 has been responsible for several phishing attacks in Europe, the US, and the Middle East and North Africa region. On September 14, 2022, the US Office of Foreign Assent Control at the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on individuals affiliated with the group.\n\nThe investigation also revealed inadequacies in Google’s security protections to safeguard its users’ data.',

        'A tightly controlled and regulated intranet was reportedly available to a growing group of users centered in Pyongyang, including an elite primary school; selected research institutions, universities, and factories; and a few individuals. The NGO Reporters without Borders reported some email access existed through this internal network. Government employees sometimes had limited, closely monitored access to email accounts. The HRNK reported that the government installed monitoring programs on every smartphone and tablet that, among other things, logged every webpage visited and randomly took undeletable screenshots.\nThe government continued its attempt to limit foreign influence on its citizens. Individuals accused of viewing or possessing foreign films were reportedly subjected to imprisonment and possibly execution, an effort expanded following the passage of the antireactionary ideology law in December 2020 (see also section 2.a., Freedom of Expression). The 2020 White Paper also reported that the number of persons executed for watching or distributing South Korean video content online increased in recent years, with additional reports of correctional labor punishment. In 2019 the HRNK reported the government’s introduction of a file watermarking system on Android smartphones and on personal computers that added a user- or device-specific data string to the end of the filename of any media file each time it was shared.',

        'Some of the women arrested for defying the new decree were identified after videos were posted online of them being harassed on public transport for not wearing the hijab properly. One, 28-year-old Sepideh Rashno, was arrested after a video circulated on social media of her being berated for “improper dress” by a fellow passenger, who was then forced off the vehicle by bystanders intervening on Rashno’s behalf. According to the human rights group Hrana, Rashno was beaten after her arrest and subsequently forced to apologise on television to the passenger who harassed her.\\n\\nRashno is not the first person to suffer violent repression as a result of going viral on the internet. In 2014, six Iranians – three men and three women – were sentenced to one year in prison and 91 lashes after a video of them dancing in Tehran to Pharrell Williams’s song Happy had more than 150,000 views.',

        "Many Dominican-born persons of Haitian descent, including children, continue to remain in undocumented status because of a legal change that retroactively revised the Dominican Republic's citizenship laws, which declared that all persons born after 1929 to non-citizens in the Dominican Republic were not eligible for citizenship. As a result, thousands of people had their citizenship revoked, most of whom were children of Haitian descent. Afterward, the government established new legal provisions aimed at providing legal pathways for these individuals to regularize their immigration status. Yet, many of those affected by the changes have been unable to obtain legal residency documents or have their citizenship reinstated. In 2020, the outgoing President issued a presidential decree naturalizing 749 of these individuals, nearly all of them minors, but the decree has still not been brought into effect. In addition, thousands of other applicants remain trapped in legal limbo. Although their cases have been approved, the government has not yet issued a decree finalizing the naturalization process. Due to the slow implementation of the program, coupled with response measures for the COVID-19 pandemic, many applicants have seen their interim identity and residency documents expire. NGOs report that applicants are often unable to renew their documents due to government office closures, high fees, and a requirement to present a foreign passport despite the fact that these applicants are Dominican-born. Some Dominican-born children of Haitian descent have been deported.",

      comment:
        'As of September, the Thai Lawyers for Human Rights reported that at least 1,860 people had been prosecuted since mid-July 2020 for exercising freedom of expression and assembly.\\n\\nSince the government ordered the nationwide enforcement of the Emergency Decree on Public Administration in Emergency Situation in March 2020 to control the spread of Covid-19, at least 1,469 people have been prosecuted under this draconian law—primarily for taking part in democracy protests. Police and prosecutors have leveled charges such as violating social distancing measures, curfew restrictions, and other disease control measures. Most of these criminal cases were not dropped after the government lifted the emergency measures on October 1.\\n\\nIn November 2020, Prime Minister Prayut ordered authorities to use all laws against democracy protesters, bringing back lèse-majesté (insulting the monarchy) prosecution under article 112 of the penal code after a three-year hiatus. Authorities have since charged at least 215 people under Article 112 in relation to various activities undertaken at democracy protests or comments made on social media. In addition, making critical or offensive comments about the monarchy is also a serious criminal offense under the Computer-Related Crime Act. Authorities have also charged some political activists with sedition under Article 116 of the penal code. ',

        'Five years after the entry into force of the General Law on the disappearance of persons in Mexico, the country has not yet acted firmly to combat this atrocious crime that affects hundreds of thousands of people. In Mexico, the law has provided some encouraging advances, such as the creation of institutions specialized in the investigation and search of disappeared persons. However, it is necessary to reinforce them. Authorities have yet to apply all that the law on disappearances offers to return missing persons to their families, eradicate near-absolute impunity for these crimes, and prevent others from suffering the same fate. Currently, only 2-6% of disappearance cases are prosecuted, and fewer than 40 convictions have been achieved to date. Official records from five years ago indicated more than 47,000 cases of disappearances. Since then, at least another 45,000 people have disappeared, and in the case of another 17,000, the authorities have not determined exactly when the disappearance occurred.\\n\\nThe implementation of the tools required by law remains insufficient. The National Forensic Data Bank has not yet been created; the National Registry of Unidentified and Unclaimed Deceased Persons; the National Registry of Graves; the National Exhumation Program; the National Search Program and the Regulations of the Law.\\n\\nMisinformation and insensitivity to these crimes continue to be widespread among many public officials, and the criteria for determining their responsibility are not adequately applied.',

        'About 2,000 accused gang members were moved to the 40,000-capacity ‘Terrorism Confinement Centre’ (Cecot), considered to be the largest prison in the Americas, on Friday.\\nIn a video posted by Bukele, prisoners stripped down to white shorts, with their heads shaved, are seen running through the new prison into cells. Many bear gang tattoos.\\nBukele asked his allies in El Salvador’s congress to pass a state of exception last year, which has since been extended several times, that suspends some constitutional rights after a dramatic increase in murders attributed to violent gangs.\\nSince then, more than 64,000 suspects have been arrested in the anti-crime dragnet. Arrests can be made without a warrant, private communications are accessible by the government, and detainees no longer have the right to a lawyer.\\nHuman rights organisations argue that innocent people have been caught up in the policy, including dozens who have died in police custody.\\n\\nBut Bukele’s anti-gang push remains widely popular with Salvadorans, and the country’s security minister told Reuters it would continue until all criminals are captured.',

      comment:
        'Girls across Afghanistan have been denied their right to learn for over three years – first, due to COVID-19, and then because of the ban on attending secondary school. The cumulative impact of these absences is taking a terrible toll on girls’ mental health, overall wellbeing and on their futures.\\n\\n“Girls and adolescents, including those with disabilities, have the right to an education. Preventing girls from learning will also have far-reaching consequences for the country’s economy and health system.\\n\\n“There is a chorus of girls’ voices all over Afghanistan urging us to find practical solutions for their education. Maryam, a sixth grader, told my UNICEF colleagues in Afghanistan, ‘Going to school is the light of life. If we don’t go to school, our lives will be dark.’',

      comment:
        'According to WRC  numerous individuals and family members who expressed fear of remaining in northern Mexico while they waited to secure a Custom Border Protection ( CBP)  appointment. Women of many nationalities who were survivors of domestic violence or had received threats from gangs expressed fear that they would be tracked down by their persecutors in northern Mexico. Many reported abuses such as beating, extortion, and arbitrary detention by Mexican immigration authorities on the migratory route. Other individuals—including families traveling with young children—were kidnapped in northern Mexico and held for several days while their family members were extorted for their release. Their horrific experiences are consistent with the State Department’s issuance of Do Not Travel advisories for these regions due to crime and kidnapping. WRC is concerned that the Biden administration plans to deport non-Mexican nationals to Mexico, where many face insecurity, uncertain immigration status, and danger upon return.4 ',

      comment:
        'The pervasive cycle of online sexual abuse impacting minors in the country extends beyond familial boundaries, permeating communities susceptible to these criminal activities, often under the guise of a lucrative "cottage industry." These findings stem from a comprehensive two-year study. The research revealed that a significant number of "facilitators" of online sexual abuse were female family members or individuals perceived as "trusted," such as friends or neighbors, typically aged between 20 and 25 years old.',

        "As ACLED reports, disinformation trends were indentified after Peruvian local elections:  voters headed to the polls for local elections . The mayoral race in the capital city Lima drew attention both from inside Lima and other areas of Peru, with conservative Rafael López Aliaga narrowly beating out retired military leader Daniel Urresti. Lima is the center of the opposition to President Pedro Castillo's administration; now, the newly elected mayor López Aliaga is calling for Castillo to be ousted, paving the way to a conflict between the local and national governments. Urresti's supporters demonstrated outside the ballot count in Moro district, expressing their discontent with the results of Lima's mayoral election and claiming the vote was fraudulent (Diario de Chimbote, 4 October 2022). Similarly, in the Rahua region, demonstrators burnt down ballot boxes and electoral material, rejecting the result. In addition, the rioters attacked police, military offices, and representatives of the Decentralized Electoral Process Office and the Special Electoral Jury. These trends contribute to the 60% increase in violent events in Peru over the past week relative to the previous month's weekly average, as flagged by ACLED's Conflict Change Map.",

The number of people who are food insecure has increased as well, as of December 2020, the rate of food insecurity rose to 49%, up from 29% only a year before, and 47% of the refugees at the marginal level to be food insecure. The main reason for this increase – besides the economic and social instability– is the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, creating further competition over jobs and services. The different COVID-19 contingency measures that took place in Lebanon have compounded the already deteriorating social development and economic growth, deepening the humanitarian needs, and exacerbated pre-existing vulnerabilities. Therefore, Lebanon has experienced a loss of employment, low income, and an increase in basic items cost.

The pre-existing vulnerabilities including: \n1) Security risks, \n2) Political and ethnic tensions and presence of armed groups \n3) Resource-constrained communities, \n4) COVID-19,\n5) Basic services are overstretched and or not functional,\n6) Logistical and administrative constraints make challenge smooth roll out of humanitarian activities.\n\nNot everyone with the same characteristics will experience the same level of vulnerability. Women in general; Adolescent girls at risk of early or forced marriage; Unaccompanied and separated children; Children engaging in child labour; Tensions between refugee and host communities; Refugee without documentation; Rural vs Urban; Refugees, asylum seekers, migrants and the economically vulnerable population. \n',

        'The speed-filling of the GRED scheduled at the beginning of 2022 is likely to increase tension between Ethiopia and Sudan and result in shortages of water resources for Sudan, mainly in the Nile River, Blue Nile, and Sennar states and disrupt livelihood activities that are dependent on water. \nThe Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) has been a source of tension between Sudan and Ethiopia for more than 10 year. The GERD is located in Ethiopia’s western Benishangul-Gumuz regional state, only 15 kilometers from the border with Sudan. The reservoir of the GERD are filled from the Blue Nile, which is the main source of water for Sudan. It has only been filled twice until now, and the third filling will take place at the beginning of 2022. Tensions between the two countries increase with each filling, as Sudan is likely to suffer from shortages of water resources. \nAnalysts expect that when the GERD’s reservoir are completely filled, 50% of land (50,000 feddans) that depends on spate irrigation in the Nile River, Blue Nile, and Sennar states will be affected. About 20 million people will be affected in three agricultural seasons. The country will turn to high-cost irrigation, especially with the lack of electricity and petroleum materials. Lack of silt from the Nile means less natural nourishment for agricultural lands and the disruption of the red brick industry. Levels of groundwater will decrease, and it requires high costs to compensate. \nAgricultural activities in Sudan are likely to be at risk of massive flooding in case of any mismanagement of the GERD’s filling operations or overfilling the GERD. People living around the Ethiopian-Sudanese borderlands will be highly affected. Previously in September 2020, three million people were affected and more than 100 killed because of a flooding of the Blue Nile, while the flooding’s waste damaged two-thirds of the country’s cultivated land.\n\nThe situation as of April 2022: Ethiopia scheduled a third filling in July 2022 and on 20 February, it started electricity production using the GERD. \n Tension increases after the third filling of the GERD scheduled at the beginning of 2022.

        'Tunisian President Kais Saied suspended parliament, revoked legu0002islators’ parliamentary immunity, and dismissed Prime Minister \nHichem Mechichi on 25 July in response to increasing protests \nagainst the failure of the COVID-19 response and the economic \ncrisis.  In 2020, the GDP contracted by almost 9%, \nand unemployment among young people increased to over 40% \n(GIEWS 27/07/2021). The President’s decision led to a deepening constitutional crisis.  Kais Saied extended the parliament’s suspension indefinitely on  23 August and refused to hold dialogue with the Ennahda party,  which holds the majority of seats in the suspended government \n(Reuters 15/09/2021; Washington Institute 31/08/2021; Al \nJazeera 24/08/2021). On 22 September, the President’s public \nstatements suggested he is likely to seek further constitutional \nreform, which could entail complete dissolution of the parliament \nand drafting of a new constitution, possibly with a more presiu0002dential system. On 29 September, the President named a new \nprime minister, Najla Boden (Al Jazeera 22/09/2021; France 24 \n12/09/2021; African Arguments 30/08/2021). At the same time, \nthe opposition is consolidating against the presidential moves \nand calling on the President, the army, and the judiciary to respect \nthe current constitution (MEMO 19/09/2021).\nIncreasing protests took place in September, both in support \nof and in opposition to presidential decisions (Al Jazeera \n19/09/2021). Growing sociopolitical unrest is likely to trigger \nviolent police and army response, with the president warning \nthat any violent protests will be met with a military response. \nThe army’s support of the presidential power grab is concerning, \nas the Tunisian army rarely gets involved in political matters \n(Foreign Policy 2/09/2021; Al Jazeera 25/07/2021). The prou0002tests are likely to be aggravated by the prevailing political and \nprolonged economic crisis. Higher mobilisation is anticipated if \nthe economic crisis pushes the President to introduce new austerity measures or changes in subsidy policies (ICG 28/07/2021; Reuters 05/05/2021).\n\nIncreased protests are likely to trigger disproportionate police \nresponse, as the police already were reported using pepper spray \nagainst protesters and storming news agencies associated with \nthe government (Al Jazeera 25/07/2021; International Crisis \nGroup 28/07/2021). More violent protests are likely to increase \nduring December–January because of the anniversary of the \nJasmine Revolution. If violence erupts, it is expected to happen in \nTunisia’s three most populated cities: Sfax, Sousse, and Tunis. Up \nto 100,000 people across Tunisia, including migrants, would likely \nbe most affected by the economic downturn and face humanitarian needs (UNDP 15/12/2020; UNHCR)\n\nUPDATE:\nSocial and political dissatisfaction in Tunisia resulted in some violent demonstrations and human rights violations. The Tunisian president Kais Saied extended the parliament suspension until a new election on 17 December 2022 and announced a constitutional referendum to be held on July 2022. (Middle east eye 13/12/2021, Swissinfo 13/12/2021, Crisisgroup 27/01/2022). The president also terminated the Supreme Judicial Council and named a new temporary one (Swissinfo 13/02/2022, DW 06/02/2022). Those exceptional measures led to violent protests since November 2021. Riot police are reported to have used tear gas, sticks, and water cannons against the protesters, which has resulted in one death and injuries (Reuters 14/11/2021, Aljazeera 17/12/2021, DW 14/01/2022, Aljazeera 20/01/2022). Opposition movements have faced human rights violations and arbitrarily arrests (CNN 22/12/2021, Amnesty 14/01/2022).Protests occurred on 17 December 2021 and 14 January 2022 which is the Jasmin anniversary that moved from January 14 to December 17.  (Bloomberg 12/01/2022, Aljazeera 17/12/2021, Voanews 14/01/2022). \nMigrants and refugees’ socioeconomic situation deteriorated and many of them are without jobs. They are subject to exploitation such as human trafficking, forced labour, and arbitrary arrests. Migrants protested on 14 February asking for evacuation from Tunisia (Infomigrants 15/02/2022, Africanews 15/02/2022).

A liquidity crisis would likely push the Taliban to resort to traditional illegal income sources, increasing the risk that Afghanistan will be blacklisted as a country with a high risk of money laundering and terror financing, subjecting it to further sanctions and regulations. Such a financial crisis would likely cause Afghanistan’s GDP to contract by up to 13% in 2022. The economy is expected to shrink further, triggered by high inflation, devaluation of the Afghani, a rise in unemployment, and disruption of industrial production, market, and domestic supply chains.

These needs are likely to be compounded by sporadic violence, drought, displacement, and COVID-19 impact. Humanitarian access in the country is already highly constrained and changing regulations and financial constraints could further hamper response in the country.\n',

        "The AGC (also known as Clan del Golfo) is currently the most powerful criminal organisation in Colombian territory. Its territorial control is centred in Urabá Antioqueño, Urabá Chocoano and the south of the department of Córdoba. The leader of the organization, alias Otoniel, was captured last 25 October. The organisation has responded by killing several military and police officers in its regions of operation. However, the lack of leadership in the organisation could destabilise its territorial control and encourage its armed competitors (other organisations such as Los Caparros, ACSN, FARC-EP dissidents and the ELN) to attack and weaken them. When disputes between armed actors in Colombia increase, the consequences for the civilian population (such as confinement, forced displacement, assassination of social leaders, among others) tend to increase. The capture of Otoniel could lead to new disputes for the control of AGC territories and, therefore, could threaten the civilian population, mainly in the organisation's areas of operation (Urabá Antioqueño, Urabá Chocoano and the south of the department of Córdoba). The capture of Clan del Golfo leader, Dairo Antonio Úsuga David, alias Otoniel, could aggravate the armed confrontation in areas where the armed group had territorial control: (i) Southern Córdoba (disputed with Caparros and Disidencias of the FARC's 18th Front); (ii) Urabá Antioqueño (disputed with Caparros and the ELN); and (iii) Urabá Chocoano (disputed with the ELN).",

        'Between 9–11 September 2023, Storm Daniel caused flooding and destruction in the coastal areas of northeastern Libya, including the collapse of two dams in Derna district that killed thousands of people. As at 16 September, WHO had recorded almost 4,000 deaths, and more than 9,000 people were still missing. OCHA estimates that the floods affected 884,000 people to varying degrees. As at the end of September, more than 40,000 people were displaced, including at least 16,000 in Derna city and surrounding areas. People living in flood-affected areas are in urgent need of fresh water, as the floodwaters have washed away, buried in mud, or damaged entire residential zones, including water and sewage networks. Satellite imagery analysis indicates that over 2,200 buildings have been destroyed in the city. Half of the 18 boreholes for drinking water are also out of service. The consequent contamination of soil and groundwater, poor hygiene, and a lack of sanitation facilities are creating a risk of waterborne disease outbreaks, such as acute watery diarrhoea and cholera, and vector-borne disease outbreaks, such as malaria and typhoid, dengue, and yellow fever. Because of their more fragile immune systems, older people, children, and pregnant women are particularly at risk of these diseases. More than half of the 78 health facilities assessed by WHO in two districts and in Derna city are either closed or not functioning because of infrastructure damage and shortages of staff, medicine, supplies, and equipment. Given the weaknesses of the health system and the magnitude of health needs, a public health crisis is looming. Floodwaters have also shifted explosive remnants of war left over from years of conflict, posing a risk to residents and displaced people.\n\nAs at 6 October 2023, there were 2380 cases of acute diarrhoea and 5 cases of bloody diarrhoea reported in the flood affected areas. The epidemiological situation in flood-affected areas has been reportedly stable since December 2023, with no increase in waterborne diseases reported.\n - The impact of Storm Daniel\n- WASH infrastructure damage\n- Water contamination\n- Overwhelmed health sector',

Because of their more fragile immune systems, older people, children, and pregnant women are particularly at risk of these diseases. More than half of the 78 health facilities assessed by WHO in two districts and in Derna city are either closed or not functioning because of infrastructure damage and shortages of staff, medicine, supplies, and equipment. Given the weaknesses of the health system and the magnitude of health needs, a public health crisis is looming. Floodwaters have also shifted explosive remnants of war left over from years of conflict, posing a risk to residents and displaced people.\n\nAs at 6 October 2023, there were 2380 cases of acute diarrhoea and 5 cases of bloody diarrhoea reported in the flood affected areas. The epidemiological situation in flood-affected areas has been reportedly stable since December 2023, with no increase in waterborne diseases reported.\n',

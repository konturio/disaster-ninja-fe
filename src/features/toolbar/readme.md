## Toolbar

Collapsible panel that provides map tools.

### Behavior

Toolbar has two states: expanded (full) and collapsed (short). In the full state buttons display text labels and tooltips are hidden. In the short state buttons show only icons and tooltips appear on hover.

### How to use

Import `toolbar` and `shortToolbar` panel states from `~features/toolbar` and pass them to `FullAndShortStatesPanelWidget`.

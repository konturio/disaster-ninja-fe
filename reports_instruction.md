### An example of the internal structure of osm_reports_list.json

`[{"id": "your_report_id",
  "link": "/your_report.csv",
  "name": "your report name",
  "sortable": true,
  "last_updated": "2022-09-18T18:59:51Z",
  "public_access": true,
  "description_full": "full description",
  "description_brief": "brief description",
  "searchable_columns_indexes": [0]},
  {another report description}]`

## How to show reports on DN2

Reports have to be served by some web server. 
Standalone configuration expects that reports are served at /reports/ subpath - as shown in default DN Front End configuration:
`"REPORTS_API": "https://disaster.ninja/active/reports"`

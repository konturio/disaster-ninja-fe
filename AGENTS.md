Notes for agents: 
 * Use Conventional Commits convention when formatting the pull request and commits, e.g. `type(scope): TICKETNUMBER title ...`.
 * Reference Fibery ticket in the PR description and headline.
 * Branch names should match branch name recorded by Fibery if provided (e.g. "21648-switch-page-after-login-to-map").
 * Every feature needs to have comprehensive up-to-date documentation in readme near it.
 * docs/ folder has general project documentation that needs to be kept up to date.
 * Code test coverage is measured by codecov. Write useful tests to increase it and check key requirements to hold.
